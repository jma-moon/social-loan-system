# social-loan-system

Drools implementation that helps to decide if someone is able to get a loan to buy a property

## I have learned

I have learned the basic use of JBoss Drools tools creating a set of rules that can resolve this problem, I have used constants to make more configurable rules.
I have used design patterns to create a system that does not depend on Drools and can be extended easily.

## To do

Refactor printing methods that are in the Main class
Create a graphic interface and provide users the hability to create loan requests by themselves
